DayZ-Private
============
Custom DB connection between server and DayZ

If your vehicles don't spawn check your regional setting for numbers and set the decimal separator for fractions to '.' (dot)

You can now set separate timezones for each instance in the database modifying the values in the instances table

You no longer need to generate any pbos. Just merge this repository with your main ArmA directory!

If you have dayz1_5.sql you can just run objectfix1_5to1_6.sql, if not please install dayz1_6.sql
