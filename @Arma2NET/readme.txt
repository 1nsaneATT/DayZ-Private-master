Arma2NET 1.9 - https://bitbucket.org/Scott_NZ/arma2net

 Arma2NET is a wrapper used for communicating between managed code and SQF code used in the game Arma 2, adding significant functionality to SQF scripting.

Features

 - Call managed functions and manipulate the return value from SQF.
 - Check the status of long-running managed functions from SQF using callbacks.
 - Convert SQF literals (lists, strings, numbers etc) to .NET objects and back.
 - Extend the functionality of Arma2NET by writing plugins written in any language that compiles to .NET bytecode, such as C#, F# or VB.NET.
